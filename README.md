## Basic kafka project
This is a basic kafka project with two python files one is producer and other is consumer. The producer file generates random cities' with their weather data and pushes the data to a topic and the consumer consumes the data from the topic.

### Notes:
- For this setup, python 3.11 is used and is not working with latest python 3.12.
- And also kafka-python library is not working had to use confluent-kafka
